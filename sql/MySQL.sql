-- Subqueries
-- ========================

-- Subquery in the SELECT clause
SELECT FIRST_NAME AS ID1,
       (SELECT FIRST_NAME FROM USERS WHERE ID = 2) AS ID2
FROM USERS
WHERE ID = 1;

-- Subquery in the FROM clause
SELECT * FROM
    (SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE ID = 1) AS TEMPORARY;

-- Subquery in the WHERE clause using ALL keyword
-- The ALL operator compares a value against all values returned by a subquery.
SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS P
WHERE PRICE > ALL (
    SELECT PRICE FROM PRODUCTS P2 WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'INDUSTRIAL'
);

-- Subquery in the WHERE clause using SOME keyword
-- The SOME operator compares a value against any value returned by a subquery.
SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS P
WHERE PRICE > SOME (
    SELECT PRICE FROM PRODUCTS P2 WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'HOME'
);

-- ========================
-- Correlated vs Non-Correlated Subquery
-- ========================
/*
  * Correlated Subquery:
  * References columns from the outer query, allowing it to return different results for each row processed by the outer query.

  * Non-Correlated Subquery:
  * Independent of the outer query, returning a single result set used by the main query.
*/

-- Correlated Subquery
SELECT name, department, price
FROM products p
WHERE p.price = (
    SELECT MAX(price)
    FROM products p2
    WHERE p2.department = p.department

-- ========================
-- Views
-- ========================

-- Creating a view to show maximum priced products by department

    SELECT MAX(price)
    FROM products p2

-- Selecting from the view and ordering by price
SELECT * FROM maxPriceView ORDER BY price;

-- Dropping the view

-- Stored Procedures
-- ========================
-- A stored procedure contains a block of SQL code to retrieve/store data.

-- Transactions & Concurrency
-- ========================
/*
A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit of work.
It ensures that these operations either succeed completely or fail completely, maintaining data integrity.

ACID Properties
=================
1. Atomicity: Ensures that a transaction is all-or-nothing.
2. Consistency: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
3. Isolation: Ensures that the operations of one transaction are independent of other concurrent transactions.
4. Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes made are permanent.
*/

-- Stored procedure to update a transaction
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE updateTrnxProc(id INT, value VARCHAR(20))
BEGIN
    START TRANSACTION;
    INSERT INTO transactions (id, value) VALUES (id, 'DummyData');

    IF VALUE IS NULL THEN
        ROLLBACK;
    ELSE
        UPDATE transactions t SET t.value = value WHERE t.id = id;
        COMMIT;

/*
Concurrency Problems:
1. Dirty Reads: A transaction reads uncommitted changes from another transaction.
2. Non-repeatable Reads: A transaction re-reads data and finds that the data has changed due to another transactionâ€™s commit.
3. Phantom Reads: New rows are inserted by another transaction that may not be available in the current transaction.

Isolation Levels:
1. READ UNCOMMITTED: Allows transactions to see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
2. READ COMMITTED: Transactions only see changes committed by other transactions.
3. REPEATABLE READ: Ensures that if a transaction reads data, the same data is read again even if other transactions modify it. (MySQL's default)
4. SERIALIZABLE: The strictest isolation level where transactions are executed one at a time, ensuring no overlap.
